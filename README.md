[![img](https://github.com/Agnieszka1994/Traffic-Simulation/blob/main/data/traffic_simulation.gif)](https://github.com/Agnieszka1994/Traffic-Simulation/blob/main/data/)


This repo contains the final project of the Udacity concurrent programming course. 

The purpose of this project was to develop a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections. 
The last phase was to equip each section with traffic lights and to build a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation. 

## Requirements

- compiler support for C++17 (gcc/g++ >= 5.4).
- cmake >= 3.11
- make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/) library => 4.1

## Get started
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Agnieszka1994/Traffic-Simulation
cd Traffic-Simulation/
mkdir build && cd build/
cmake ..
make
```
